1. Baysian-on-Nashville-rain - Used bayesian statistics to find the best parameters of the nashville rainfall dataset.  
2. Storybook-using-python - Used OpenCV, PIL and pandas to create a cartoonized storybook from raw images and add sutitles. 
3. Method-of-Moments.ipynb - Used MOM to find most likely parameters (Exponential Distribution) for Data set containing revenue of Disney movies. 
4. MLE-on-top500-Movies - Used Maximum Likelihood Estimation to fit an Exponential Distribution on dataset containing production budget of 500 costliest movies ever made. 
5. F1-Probability - Solved the following question using Monte Carlo Simulation and Combinatrics :

    Professor is curious whether he has the same probability to meet a F1 driver if he goes to one of seven shows for the whole duration of the show and if 7 F1 racers go to 7 shows where each racer goes to one and only one show for 7 minutes, or if one F1 driver goes to one or more of 7 shows for exactly 7 times and for 7 minutes each time (so for example, the sole F1 driver could theoretically go to one show only, then leave, then come back, and repeat this seven times for a visit total of 49 minutes without going to any other show). Which of the two experiments give professor a higher probability of meeting a F1 driver?
